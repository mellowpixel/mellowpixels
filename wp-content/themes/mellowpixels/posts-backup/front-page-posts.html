		<h3>Website for the Berlin based branch of "Allianz"</h3>
		<p>
			Wordpress website for the Berlin branch of international insurance company Allianz.
			Apart from the website development, I enjoyed working with the Allianz team on generation of ideas on how to make their busy life easier.
			We took their routine tasks online and added useful features like: 
			<ul>
				<li>online Appointments calendar and appointments booking</li>
				<li>Quote requests</li>
				<li>The gallery of Insurance cases</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			We also had some good fun during photoshoot, when I was asked to take pictures of team and the office.
