<strong>The Company: </strong><br>
<p>Ownster was a long term project, that has been designed and developed from a scratch, then has been remade, reworked, updated and extended several times during my long time relationship with the company. In fact this is the third version of the website.</p>

<p>Ownster offers a unique customizable product, which a user can personalise online and get it delivered to his / her porch within three business days on average.</p>
<p>There are many personalisation features and abilities at a user's disposal.<br>Here are a few major ones:
<ul>
	<li>Variety of predesigned adjustable styles of the product for a selection of occasions.</li>
	<li>Picture upload from a user's account on Facebook and Instagram, as well as upload from a user's hand-held device's library or from the hard drive of the computer.</li>
	<li>A good selection of layouts for uploaded pictures.</li>
	<li>Positioning and cropping of an uploaded picture on a surface of a product.</li>
	<li>Tools that let user write his own fully customizable text on the surface of a product. A variety of fonts, sizes and colours are available.</li>
	<li>User may select type of a material for his product and a color of it.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>At the moment the company offers several types of PVC wallets to hold plastic cards, travel cards etc. The product is very popular among Londoners and Dubliners, to hold their "Oyster" and "Leap" travel cards.</p>
<p>There is also a selection of notebooks and organisers on offer. Those could also be personalized just as easy.</p>

<strong>The Front-end Web Application:</strong>
<p>My main focus at the front-end was a User's Experience and the ease of use. The idea was to make the navigation on pages as intuitive and obvious as possible. Everything here rely on a well-known navigational components like drop-down menus, links, buttons and banners.</p>

<p>In the heart of the website is the product personalisation page. It is very intuitive and easy to use. The product is personalised in just a few simple steps. The user is leaded in the process of creation by means of hints and messages where needed. It is so easy, that even my grandparents could do it! And a tone of feedbacks from customers confirm that.</p>
<p>For the sake of usability we've developed two slightly different versions of an interface for desktop users and for those who use their mobile device to personalise a product.</p>
<p>The website is fully responsive and mobile friendly. And this is what we all want from a webpage nowadays. Mobile-friendly pages get ranked higher in search engines and attract more users, because the vast majority of user's pictures in our decades are stored on mobile devices.</p>

<strong>CMS. The Administrator's page: </strong>
<p>The unique content management system has been written from a scratch and carefully tailored to the specific needs and requirements of the Ownster's team.</p>
<p>The most advanced and complex part of the CMS is the product editor and creator app. It let it's user create complex personalized virtual products with any imaginary layouts, presets, designs etc.</p>
<p>We've created some essential as well as unique tools for the manager and the administrator of the website. Those are:</p>
<strong>â€¢ Order management page</strong>. Here the production manager can view new orders, see contact information about the order, download a user designed style of the product for printing. <br>
<strong>â€¢ Sales Statistics</strong><br>
<strong>â€¢ Vouchers system</strong><br>
<strong>â€¢ Promotions editor</strong><br>
<strong>â€¢ Feedback moderation system</strong><br>
<strong>â€¢ User statistics page</strong><br>

<strong>Back-end</strong>
<p>The work on the back-end of the website engaged multiple skills, involved lots of programming, problem solving and apache configuring.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key tasks that were created for the back-end:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Search Engine Optimisation.</li>
		<li>Handling of XMLhttp Requests from the front-end.</li>
		<li>Communication with Facebook, Instagram and PayPal API's</li>
		<li>Generation of new order folders and files.</li>
		<li>Pages generation</li>
		<li>MySql communication and user input verification</li>
		<li>User authentication</li>
		<li>Email Sending</li>
	</ul>
